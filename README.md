# ❤️ Heart Disease Symptom Checker

This is a simple Python project that helps you explore possible **heart diseases** based on the symptoms you enter. It’s made to give you a basic idea of what might be going on—just like a virtual conversation—but it’s **not** a replacement for real medical advice.

## What Is This Project About?
This program is a beginner-friendly **Heart Disease Symptom Diagnostic**. You answer a few **yes or no** questions about common heart-related symptoms, and it gives you a ranked list of **5 potential heart conditions**, from most likely to least likely.

After that, it goes a step further by grabbing **live info** about the most likely disease from **WebMD**, so you can read up on it immediately.

## How It Works
1. You run the program.
2. It asks about symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, etc.
3. It scores your answers and ranks five possible heart conditions.
4. It shows you more details about the #1 ranked disease—pulled straight from WebMD.
